# NAVA
NAVA, Neural Architecture Variation Analyzer, is a small C++ tool that helps you test different neural network structures to see which one works best.  Instead of guessing how many layers or neurons to use, NAVA tries out combinations automatically. It builds, trains, and compares different networks so you can find the best setup for your task.
